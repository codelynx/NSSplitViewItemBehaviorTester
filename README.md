# NSSplitViewItemBehaviorTester
Experimenting NSSplitViewItemBehavior a part of NSSplitViewController

NSSplitViewItemBehavior was introduced from OS X 10.11 El Capitan.  But there are nearly no documentation
at all at this point (Mar 2016).  This sample project provides a NSSplitViewController with 
three split view items, and each represents 'Content List', 'Default' and 'Sidebar'.

As far as, I found is that there are some color differences between 'Content List' and 'Sidebar',
but I haven't found any other noticeable behavior differences.

Please give me feedback, if you found any.
